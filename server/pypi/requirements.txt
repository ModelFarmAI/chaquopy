# These packages are included by default in a new virtualenv, but since we use them directly,
# specify exact versions for reproducible builds.
# pip 18.1 was the last version that didn't have the (buggy?) PEP517 behavior of
# importing setup.py when downloading the source tarball. However, 18.1 doesn't work
# on Python 3.10. 19.2 is the earliest version that works with Python 3.10
pip==19.2
# We use a setuptools < 60 for compatibility with numpy's vendored distutils.
setuptools<60
wheel==0.37.1

# Other direct requirements
Jinja2==3.1.2
jsonschema==2.6.0
pyelftools==0.24
PyYAML==6.0
